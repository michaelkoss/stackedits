# Overview

## Goal
Inform stakeholders when features will be done

## Estimation
1. Give each unit of work a `value` based on effort
2. Track how many `values` are completed each `cycle`
3. Calculate `velocity` (`values`/`cycle`) for the team

## Planning
1. What is the most important functionality we can fit into this `cycle`
2. We can extrapolate our `velocity` to project when a set of features will be done

## Difference
We don't pick functionality then guess a date
We pick a date, then plan the functionality we can accomplish by then

# Relative Estimation

## Estimation
- is hard and inaccurate...we are not good at it
	- optimists and pessimists..waste time arguing
	- time spent estimating does not generate more accuracy
	- software is ambiguous
	- we know the least about a project/feature at the start
- humans are much better at relative estimation
	- comparing is much quicker and more accurate than deconstructing

> "It is better to be **roughly right** than **precisely wrong**."
	> *- John Maynard Keynes*

## Relative Estimation Game - Freezer Meals
```
1. Grilled Salmon
2. Spaghetti
3. Hot Dogs
4. Mac n' Cheese
5. Bologna Sandwich
6. Lasagna
7. Fajitas
8. Fried Rice
9. Pad Thai
10. Chocolate Chip Cookies 
11. Chili
12. Jello
13. Steak and Potatoes
14. Enchiladas 
```
### Steps
1. Relatively estimate the time it takes to prepare each Freezer Meal
2. Assign points to each column
3. It's our Friday off, so we can commit to preparing meals Friday, Saturday, and Sunday afternoon
	- Guesstimate how many points we can accomplish each afternoon
4. We can accomplish 25 points per afternoon
5. Replace the idea of *Freezer Meals* with *User Stories* and replace *you* with *our team*


### Fibonacci Scale
- implies exponentially rising difficulty
- `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21`
- Points are completely arbitrary and have no correlation to time

# Planning
> "When preparing for battle, I find that **plans are useless** but **planning is indispensable**."
	> *- Dwight D Eisenhower*

Plans are static, planning is adaptive
	
- Typically, a team is given a project and asked when it will be done
- Agile flips that and asks, over the next `cycle`, what work can we accomplish
- Calculate a team `velocity` and
