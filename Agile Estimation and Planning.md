# Overview

## Goal
Inform stakeholders when features will be done

## Estimation
1. Give each unit of work a `value` based on effort
2. Track how many `values` are completed each `cycle`
3. Calculate `velocity` (`values`/`cycle`) for the team

## Planning
1. What is the most important functionality we can fit into this `cycle`
2. We can extrapolate our `velocity` to project when a set of features will be done

## Difference
We don't pick functionality then guess a date
We pick a date, then plan the functionality we can accomplish by then

# Relative Estimation

### Estimation
- is hard and inaccurate...we are not good at it
- time spent estimating does not generate more accuracy
- humans are much better at relative estimation


### Relative Estimation Game
```
1. Kraft Mac n' Cheese
2. Thanksgiving Dinner
3. Spaghetti
4. Bologna Sandwich
5. Hot Dogs
6. Chili
7. Lasagna
8. Grilled Salmon
9. 
```

### Fibonacci Scale
- implies exponentially rising difficulty
- `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21`

# Planning
- Typically, a team is given a project and asked when it will be done
- Agile flips that and asks, over the next `cycle`, what work can we accomplish
- Calculate a team `velocity` and
