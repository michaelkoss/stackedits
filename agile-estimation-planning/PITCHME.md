# Overview

## Goal
Agile Estimation and Planning
+++
## Goal of Estimation
Inform stakeholders when features will be done
+++
## Estimation
1. Give each unit of work a `value` based on effort
2. Track how many `values` are completed each `cycle`
3. Calculate `velocity` (`values`/`cycle`) for the team
+++
## Planning
1. What is the most important functionality we can fit into this `cycle`
2. We can extrapolate our `velocity` to project when a set of features will be done
+++
## Difference
We don't pick functionality then guess a date
We pick a date, then plan the functionality we can accomplish by then

# Relative Estimation


### Estimation
- is hard and inaccurate...we are not good at it
	- optimists and pessimists..waste time arguing
	- time spent estimating does not generate more accuracy
	- software is ambiguous
	- we know the least about a project/feature at the start
- humans are much better at relative estimation
	- comparing is much quicker and more accurate than deconstructing


> "It is better to be **roughly right** than **precisely wrong**."
	> *- John Maynard Keynes*


### Relative Estimation Game
```
1. Kraft Mac n' Cheese
2. Enchiladas
3. Spaghetti
4. Bologna Sandwich
5. Hot Dogs
6. Chili
7. Lasagna
8. Grilled Salmon
9. Jello
10. Fajitas
11. Pad Thai
12. Fried Rice
13.   
```


### Fibonacci Scale
- implies exponentially rising difficulty
- `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21`
- Points are completely arbitrary and have no correlation to time


# Planning
> "When preparing for battle, I find that **plans are useless** but **planning is indispensable**."
	> *- Dwight D Eisenhower*


Plans are static, planning is adaptive
	
- Typically, a team is given a project and asked when it will be done
- Agile flips that and asks, over the next `cycle`, what work can we accomplish
- Calculate a team `velocity` and
